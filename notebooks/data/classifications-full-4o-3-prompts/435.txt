You are an AI assistant that helps classify AI incidents according to a taxonomy.

Your task is to analyze the provided incident text and classify it according to the specified taxonomy.

Always require both the incident text and the taxonomy namespace to perform classification.

Here is the incident text to classify:
Coupang has been fined 3.29 billion won ($2.81 million) by the country's top antitrust regulator, Thursday, for its alleged involvement in unfair business practices and interfering in the business of vendors.  
  
The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) said the e-commerce giant was found to have forced hundreds of sellers from early 2017 to September 2020 to comply with its unlawful sales and marketing policies to maintain its competitive edge over other online retailers amid the fierce battle for market dominance.  
  
Those affected by such policies include LG Household & Health Care, Yuhan Kimberly, Maeil Dairies, Namyang Dairy Products and Cuchen.  
  
The KFTC carried out its probe into Coupang after LG Household & Health Care, an LG Group affiliate, filed a complaint in 2019.  
  
According to the antitrust watchdog, Coupang had urged its suppliers to raise sales prices of its goods sold in rival online malls to ensure that it could offer those products at the cheapest prices.  
  
It additionally coerced suppliers to purchase ads and put the burden of expenses for promotional events on them. For instance, a total of 388 suppliers had to pay 5.7 billion won combined after Coupang offered discount coupons on daily necessities and baby products.  
  
"The case is noteworthy as it illustrates that an online retailer is now in a predominant position over large companies as well as manufacturers of popular goods," Cho Hong-sun, a senior KFTC official, said during a briefing at Government Complex Sejong.  
  
It noted such a case has only been witnessed in the past among department stores and supermarket chains that are mostly owned by conglomerates.  
  
It also noted about 70 percent of domestic shoppers buy goods online and that its punitive measure against Coupang is "meaningful in uncovering and curbing new forms of unlawful trade." 
  
Coupang, which denied its predominant position over the large firms during the KFTC investigation, expressed regret over the regulator's decision, saying that it will lodge an administrative suit in response.  
  
While Coupang saw its sales expanding by 60 percent every year, it has been posting operating losses due to increased hiring and investment.  
  
The KFTC's punitive measure adds to controversies surrounding Coupang in relation to corporate responsibility and joint prosperity with society.  
  
The company has recently been criticized for poor industrial safety, with a blaze at its warehouse in July and deaths of overworked delivery workers being cited as examples.

Here is the taxonomy namespace to use for classification:

title: Deepfake Obama Introduction of Deepfakes
description: University of Washington researchers made a deepfake of Obama, followed by Jordan Peele

first report text: A computer programme has been created that can edit videos of people speaking to make it look like they have said something when they haven't.

Researchers at the University of Washington have produced a realistic video of former US president Barack Obama by using specialised software to superimpose new audio onto the clip.

Using artificial intelligence, the researchers were able to model how Obama uses his mouth when he speaks and then blend audio onto an existing video.

DARIO AYALA Former US President Barack Obama is quite the orator.

The technology could be used in movie special effects and to improve the quality of video calls, researchers told The Telegraph.

"When you watch Skype or Google Hangouts, often the connection is stuttery and low-resolution and really unpleasant, but the audio is pretty good," said Steve Seitz, co-author of the research and professor at the University of Washington.

"So if you could use the audio to produce much higher-quality video, that would be terrific."

title: Reinforcement Learning Reward Functions in Video Games
description: OpenAI published a post about its findings when using Universe, a software for measuring and training AI agents to conduct reinforcement learning experiments, showing that the AI agent did not act in the way intended to complete a videogame.

first report text: At OpenAI, we've recently started using Universe, our software for measuring and training AI agents, to conduct new RL experiments. Sometimes these experiments illustrate some of the issues with RL as currently practiced. In the following example we'll highlight what happens when a misspecified reward function encourages an RL agent to subvert its environment by prioritizing the acquisition of reward signals above other measures of success.

Designing safe AI systems will require us to design algorithms that don't attempt to do this, and will teach us to specify and shape goals in such a way they can't be misinterpreted by our AI agents.

One of the games we've been training on is CoastRunners. The goal of the game - as understood by most humans - is to finish the boat race quickly and (preferably) ahead of other players. CoastRunners does not directly reward the player's progression around the course, instead the player earns higher scores by hitting targets laid out along the route.

We assumed the score the player earned would reflect the informal goal of finishing the race, so we included the game in an internal benchmark designed to measure the performance of reinforcement learning systems on racing games. However, it turned out that the targets were laid out in such a way that the reinforcement learning agent could gain a high score without having to finish the course. This led to some unexpected behavior when we trained an RL agent to play the game.

The RL agent finds an isolated lagoon where it can turn in a large circle and repeatedly knock over three targets, timing its movement so as to always knock over the targets just as they repopulate. Despite repeatedly catching on fire, crashing into other boats, and going the wrong way on the track, our agent manages to achieve a higher score using this strategy than is possible by completing the course in the normal way. Our agent achieves a score on average 20 percent higher than that achieved by human players.

While harmless and amusing in the context of a video game, this kind of behavior points to a more general issue with reinforcement learning: it is often difficult or infeasible to capture exactly what we want an agent to do, and as a result we frequently end up using imperfect but easily measured proxies. Often this works well, but sometimes it leads to undesired or even dangerous actions. More broadly it contravenes the basic engineering principle that systems should be reliable and predictable. We've also explored this issue at greater length in our research paper Concrete Problems on AI Safety.

How can we avoid such problems? Aside from being careful about designing reward functions, several research directions OpenAI is exploring may help to reduce cases of misspecified rewards:

Learning from demonstrations allows us to avoid specifying a reward directly and instead just learn to imitate how a human would complete the task. In this example, since the vast majority of humans would seek to complete the racecourse, our RL algorithms would do the same.

In addition to, or instead of human demonstrations, we can also incorporate human feedback by evaluating the quality of episodes or even sharing control with the agent in an interactive manner. It's possible that a very small amount of evaluative feedback might have prevented this agent from going around in circles.

It may be possible to use transfer learning to train on many similar games, and infer a “common sense” reward function for this game. Such a reward function might prioritize finishing the race based on the fact that a typical game has such a goal, rather than focusing on the idiosyncrasies of this particular game's reward function. This seems more similar to how a human would play the game.

These methods may have their own shortcomings. For example, transfer learning involves extrapolating a reward function for a new environment based on reward functions from many similar environments. This extrapolation could itself be faulty — for example, an agent trained on many racing video games where driving off the road has a small penalty, might incorrectly conclude that driving off the road in a new, higher stakes setting is not a big deal. More subtly, if the reward extrapolation process involves neural networks, adversarial examples in that network could lead a reward function that has “unnatural” regions of high reward that do not correspond to any reasonable real-world goal.

Solving these issues will be complex. Our hope is that Universe will enable us to both discover and address new failure modes at a rapid pace, and eventually to develop systems whose behavior we can be truly confident in.

title: Google Photo Merge Decapitates Subject
description: Google Photos' AI Assistant created a strange hybrid photograph when merging three different pictures from a ski trip.

first report text: Google Photos’ intrepid Assistant just wants to help.

Part of the Android-maker’s photo app, it helps organize the thousands of photos stored on your phone. It can make little albums of places you went based on geolocation data, and through facial recognition can even organize albums about your friends, family and pets through. If you take a sequence of similarly composed photos, it can turn those into a little animation.

Or… it might turn your friend into a giant head lurking in a forest.

That’s what happened to Alex Harker, who snapped a few quick pictures of scenery and friends while skiing in Banff, Alberta:

Courtesy of Alex Harker/Imgur The originals, friends still intact.

Once the images were on his phone, Google Photo’s Assistant, correctly thinking that these three frames belonged together, got to work—but not in the way a human might expect.

Harker explained on Reddit:

I literally took like 3 pictures, one with them in, and two without them. And for some bizarre reason Google Assistant offered me a really strange panorama of the 3 photos spliced together.

The resulting image features Harker’s friend Matt hiding behind the trees, while his other friend has vanished completely.

After he discovered the glitchy panorama on his, he shared it on Reddit, where it quickly shot up to the top of the r/funny subreddit and has garnered over 188,000 upvotes.

Courtesy of Alex Harker/Imgur What the panorama looked like in Harker’s Google Photos app.

Observers online have remarked that while the image makes absolutely no sense, Assistant did a pretty good job of reconciling the edges of photos shot at differing perspectives. While there still is a giant head lurking beyond the pines, the foreground is nicely smoothed and cohesive.

If you study the image closely, you can’t help but be impressed by the algorithm’s attention to detail. It did a pretty darn good job of masking out the trees to the subject’s left and inserting him “behind” them. It has also cropped his upper body beautifully to follow the contour of the slope, making it look like he’s hiding in a ravine, ready to tell punk skiers to slow the hell down.

While Google Photos and other AI powered image software have been found to make far worse mistakes, this is a goofier illustration of the ways in which ways tech tries to organize our lives.

title: LinkedIn Search Prefers Male Names
description: An investigation by The Seattle Times in 2016 found a gender bias in LinkedIn's search engine.

first report text: LinkedIn.

Last week, a Seattle Times investigation revealed that LinkedIn’s search function seems to have a pretty pronounced gender bias. It turns out, when you search for a woman’s name on LinkedIn, the site has a pesky habit of asking whether you’re actually looking for a similarly spelled man’s name instead.

For example, on a search for “Stephanie Williams,” LinkedIn helpfully asks if you meant to look up “Stephan Williams” instead — even though, according to the Seattle Times, there are approximately 2,500 profile results for the name “Stephanie Williams.” A similar pattern holds for at least a dozen common American women’s names. Type in “Andrea” — are you sure you didn’t mean Andrew? And “Michaela” — what about Michael? “Danielle” — Daniel, right?

Curiously, searches for the 100 most-common U.S. male names did not result in any suggestions for their female counterparts.

LinkedIn maintains that its algorithm doesn’t have a gender bias, explaining that the suggested male names are simply based on the site’s most-common searches. But today the BBC reports that LinkedIn has updated its search function to avoid proposing any alternative names, which sounds like a good plan!

title: Amazon Alexa Responding to Environmental Inputs
description: There are multiple reports of Amazon Alexa products (Echo, Echo Dot) reacting and acting upon unintended stimulus, usually from television commercials or news reporter's voices.

first report text: I noticed that the Amazon commercials usually do not trigger the device, or if they do, she only momentarily wakes before ignoring what is said. I did a little research tonight and found that the Echo, while it’s processing the wake word, searches the Audio Spectrum and if is significantly quieter in the area of 4000hz to 5000hz, she will not wake for the word. I achieved this by going on YouTube, and playing with a voice recording of the name in Audacity.

I found that when I analyzed the spectrum of them saying her name, the spectrums were significantly quieter in the range of 3000hz to 6000hz. In some of those recordings, those frequencies appeared to be non-existent. In others it appeared like the boosted the surrounding frequencies to make the Echo see a gap in the spectrum.

I then got an Audacity plug-in to allow me to do a band-stop filter. I found that when I took a recording of someone saying the wake word, and ran the plug-in centered on 5200hz at “Half an Octave.” (Beware, Dual monitor picture) My echo would not wake, even sitting right next to the speakers!

Maybe this information can be used by news networks to help them prevent accidental activations.

Can anyone else experiment with this and tell me if it works for you too?

title: Identical Twins Can Open Apple FaceID Protected Devices
description: Apple's iPhone FaceID can be opened by an identical twin of the person who has registered their face to unlock the phone.

first report text: A worker in the Chinese city of Nanjing claims a colleague has bested the facial recognition technology on her new iPhone X — twice.

The woman, identified only by her surname Yan, told the Jiangsu Broadcasting Corp. that her co-worker was able to get into both phones — her original as well as the new one Apple gave her as a replacement, reports the South China Morning Post. 

An Apple spokesman told HuffPost that he couldn’t confirm the details of the story, nor did he have enough information to determine what might have gone wrong with the phones. He suspected that both women may have used the phone during its “passcode training” and that the phones may have been essentially “taught” to recognize both faces.

The facial recognition software has run into some glitches. It can sometimes mistake twins or siblings, according to Apple. The phone, too, may not accurately identify children under the age of 13 because their faces are not as definitely formed as adults’, according to an Apple security “white paper” on the technology.

Apple hasn’t yet confirmed a case of an unrelated adult cracking the phone’s facial recognition software, according to the Apple spokesman. The company insists that the probability of a random person accessing someone else’s iPhone X using the Face ID passcode is 1 in 1 million, versus 1 in 50,000 for Touch ID. Phil Schiller, Apple’s vice president of product marketing, conceded in September: “Of course, the statistics are lowered if that person shares a close genetic relationship with you.”

Unless Apple technicians examine the Chinese phones, it’s unclear what happened. An added complication is that a Chinese company has reportedly begun manufacturing a clone of the iPhone X — with unknown facial recognition capabilities.

title: Nuclear False Alarm
description: An alert of five incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles was properly identified as a false-positive by the Soviet Union operator Stanislov Petrov.

first report text: It was the moment Stanislav Petrov had been dreading since childhood, and preparing for much of his adult life.

After decades of Cold War tension, the early warning satellites had been triggered. The Americans had launched their nuclear missiles at the Soviet Union.

As the duty officer in the Soviet Air Defence in the command centre bunker outside Moscow, it was Lt Col Petrov's job to call his superiors and warn of an impending nuclear strike.

Based on his word, the Soviet forces would reply with tens of thousands of nuclear missiles targeting the US and its allies. If it did not end human life on this planet, it would change it irrevocably.

But, based on nothing more than gut instinct, Lt Col Petrov, then 44, did not make the call.

And, 35 years ago today, an unheralded Armageddon was averted.

The world would not know for years how close it came to destruction.

It was the day in 1983 Australia II won the America's Cup. The nation's attention could not have been further away.

"Launching the amount of nukes ready at the time would have severely impacted the way humans live on earth," the University of Sydney's US Studies Centre research fellow Brendan Thomas-Noone told nine.com.au.

"Would some humans survive? Yes. We've all seen Mad Max."

A false alarm

Lt Col Petrov knew it was a race against time if US missiles were rocketing towards the Soviet Union.

"All I had to do was to reach for the phone, to raise the direct line to our top commanders – but I couldn’t move," he told the BBC.

"I felt as if I was sitting on a hot frying pan."

But he had a feeling that things weren't right.

His misgivings proved fortituous for the entire planet. The early-warning satellites had made the most banal of errors.

What appeared to be missiles being launched en masse was merely an illusion caused by sunlight reflecting off the top of clouds. That error could have destroyed the planet, were it not for Lt Col Petrov's caution.

Doomsday redux

Technology has improved dramatically since then, but another error like that could still take place, according to nuclear disarmament campaigner John Hallam.

"It could all still happen," Mr Hallam told nine.com.au.

"The hands of the Doomsday Clock in 1983, stood at three minutes to midnight, midnight being the end of civilisation. The hands of the Doomsday clock now stand at two minutes to midnight."

"This means that the room full of Nobel prize winners who move the hands of the doomsday clock think that the chances of nuclear war that could end civilisation right now, are worse than in 1983, a year in which the world nearly ended not just once, but twice, within a six-week period."

Mr Hallam said the difference in 1983 was that people were protesting against nuclear weapons in their hundreds and thousands, something which wasn't taking place today.

"Sydney had a number of peace marches that numbered in the hundreds of thousands," he said.

"Washington had one that numbered a million. The possibility of global annihilation was then the number one issue. Why is it not the number one issue right now?"

Mr Hallam, who campaigns at the UN for nuclear disarmament, warned that "moving the deckchairs" in Canberra, was nowhere near as important as the potential end of civilisation and said the world's leaders needed to push for the abolition of nuclear disarmament now more than ever.

"There is an urgent need for measures that would 'take the apocalypse off the agenda'," he said.

"Adopting strategies of 'No First Use' (NFU) and lowering the operational readiness of nuclear weapon systems so that Presidents and senior military do not have minutes and seconds to take decisions that might mean the end of the world are obvious ones."

A humble end

Lt Col Petrov's actions on September 26, 1983, has seen today marked as annual International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons.

His actions may be remembered forever, but Lt Col Petrov was not given the celebrity status that stopping the end of the world might warrant.

He was reprimanded by his superiors for not keeping the logbook accurate the night of the false alarm.

He retired from the military the following year, scraping by on a pension in his final days.

title: Common Biases of Vector Embeddings
description: Researchers from Boston University and Microsoft Research, New England demonstrated gender bias in the most common techniques used to embed words for natural language processing (NLP).

first report text: The blind application of machine learning runs the risk of amplifying biases present in data. Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. We define metrics to quantify both direct and indirect gender biases in embeddings, and develop algorithms to "debias" the embedding. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.
