You are an AI assistant that helps classify AI incidents according to a taxonomy.

Your task is to analyze the provided incident text and classify it according to the specified taxonomy.

Always require both the incident text and the taxonomy namespace to perform classification.

Here is the incident text to classify:
OpenAI’s ChatGPT has stirred the hornet’s nest since its launch, with the Twitterverse readily commenting on how the software could eventually create code, write stories, steal jobs and even [fight wildfires](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/artificial-intelligence-can-help-fight-wildfires-world-economic-forum-3697985).

But the crypto platform Immunefi is having none of that. The bounty-paying white hat – a term for individuals who hack products with the goal of patching security instead of theft – banned 15 users last week who submitted ChatGPT-regenerated reports on the platform, albeit to mixed sentiment.

Immunefi developers told CoinDesk that the platform’s reasoning on the subject is crystal clear for now.

“There’s a difference between something like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT. With the former, you are driving the process and the role of Copilot is offering useful suggestions in context, which you accept or reject as you write your program,” Immunefi told CoinDesk in a Twitter message. “With the latter, you are using a single prompt to generate something that looks like a well-written bug report, but is nonsense when analyzed further.”

“This wastes the white hat’s time, Immunefi’s time and the projects’ time. That’s why we ban ChatGPT reports,” they added.

“It’s really an art,” developers further said, referring to the act of carefully writing a well-crafted bug report that clearly lays out issues and solutions for any exploit or bug.

Immunefi went a step ahead and asked ChatGPT itself why the software shouldn’t be used for generating bug reports, to a “[satisfying response](https://twitter.com/immunefi/status/1610635391803052033).”

The bug bounty platform has over $135 million in rewards available for white hats who find out vulnerabilities on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. It [claims to have paid](https://twitter.com/immunefi/status/1572938926410854400) out more than $60 million in bounties and says the service has saved an estimated $25 billion in user funds.

As such, Immunefi said it would continue to monitor ChatGPT-generated reports even as they eventually get more sophisticated. “There are a lot of very obvious tells. If you play around with ChatGPT, you’ll start to see a lot of patterns in the output,” developers said.

“For example, no regular white hat would go out of their way to waste their time submitting a long, nicely written and well-structured bug report that has no relation to a project’s smart contracts at all,” they added.

But that’s not to say they would ever not consider unbanning the use of AI-generated bug reports in the future.

“We will keep an eye out for the development of AI tools, and we will consider unbanning their use if they are ever capable of generating real bug reports.” For now, however, it’s ban time.

Here is the taxonomy namespace to use for classification:

Annotations are peer reviewed and finally \nrandomly selected for quality control ahead of publication. \nDespite this rigorous process, mistakes do happen, and readers \nare invited to report any errors they might discover while \nbrowsing.

title: Crashes with Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS)
description: A Boeing 737 crashed into the sea, killing 189 people, after faulty sensor data caused an automated manuevering system to repeatedly push the plane's nose downward.

first report text: Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 from Addis Ababa-Bole Airport (ADD/HAAB), Ethiopia to Nairobi-Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO/HKJK), Kenya, a Boeing 737 MAX 8 registration ET-AVJ MSN 62450/7243, crashed about 6 minutes after takeoff from ADD near Bishoftu, Ethiopia, 8°52′37″N 39°15′04″E. There were no survivors among the 157 occupants. Accident investigation found that the causes were similar to those involved in the accident of Lion Air flight JT610 on 29-10-2018. Quoting from the official investigation report:
[QUOTE
3.2Probable cause of the accident
Repetitive and uncommanded airplane-nose-down inputs from the MCAS due to erroneous AOA input, and its unrecoverable activation system which made the airplane dive with the rate of -33,000 ft/min close to the ground was the most probable cause of the accident. [p. 255]
[UNQUOTE
[QUOTE
The data from the flight data recorders, as summarized in reports of the ET 302 accident and the Lion Air Flight 610 accident, indicated that if a single erroneously high AOA sensor input is received by the flight control system, MCAS can command repeated Airplane nose-down trim of the horizontal stabilizer. This unsafe condition, if not addressed, could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the Airplane , and lead to excessive Airplane nose-down attitude, significant altitude loss, and impact with terrain [p. 257]
[UNQUOTE
[QUOTE
Safety Issue Summary
On the previous Lion Air flight and the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accident flights, the DFDR recorded higher AOA sensor data on the left side than on the right (about 20° higher in the previous Lion Air flight and the Lion Air accident flight and about 59° higher on the Ethiopian Airlines accident flight). As previously stated, the MCAS becomes active when the Airplane ’s AOA exceeds a certain threshold. Thus, these erroneous AOA data inputs resulted in the MCAS activating on the accident flights and providing the
automatic AND stabilizer trim inputs. The erroneous high AOA sensor input that caused the MCAS activation also caused several other alerts and indications for the flight crews. The stick shaker was activated on both accident flights and the previous Lion Air flight. In addition, IAS DISAGREE and ALT DISAGREE alerts occurred on all three flights. Also, the Ethiopian Airlines flight crew received a Master Caution alert. Further, after the flaps were fully retracted, the unintended AND stabilizer inputs required the pilots to apply additional force to the columns to maintain the Airplane’s climb attitude. [p. 266]

title: Driverless Train in Delhi Crashes due to Braking Failure
description: A driverless metro train in Delhi, India crashed during a test run due to faulty brakes.

first report text: A Delhi Metro mishap has been reported on Tuesday. (ANI PHOTO)

Delhi Metro accident today: On December 19, during the trial run of the Magenta line, one of the trains reportedly met with an accident as it tore through an iron grill at the Kalindi Kunj Metro depot. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to visit on December 25 to inaugurate Delhi Metro’s new Magenta Line which connects Delhi Metro’s Blue line to Violet Line, from Botanical Garden to Kalindi Kunj. As of now, there are no reports of casualties. The Magenta Line came as a breather for many commuters as it will reduce the distance between Noida and South Delhi to a mere 19-minute ride. Explaining the incident, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation issued a press release stating the reason behind the mishap.

In its press release, DMRC has ordered a high-level enquiry into this incident. The enquiry will have a committee of three Executive Directors: Executive Director/ Rolling Stock (Project), Executive Director/ Rolling Stock (O&M), Executive Director/ Operations. The press release explains the entire incident.

READ the full text by DMRC on Delhi Metro accident today:

An incident occurred at 3.40 PM (1540hrs) at the Kalindi Kunj Metro depot today which is under commissioning. A trial train was moved from the workshop without testing the brake system as a result of which, while the train was moving up the ramp for washing, it rolled back and hit the adjacent boundary wall. No person was injured in the incident.

As per normal procedure prescribed, when a train enters the workshop, the brakes of the train are decommissioned so that the train and its systems including the brakes can be freely checked. As per procedure, once the train is again re-commissioned, the brakes should have been tested by the maintenance staff in the depot before the train left the shed. The train movement inside the workshop area is done manually and not by the signalling system.

Prima facie, it appears, this was not done and subsequently, the person who took charge of the train from the maintenance staff also did not check the brake and proceeded with the train up to the washing plant built on a ramp. While stopping at the ramp, since the brakes were not available, the train rolled back causing this incident.

MD, DMRC has ordered a high-level enquiry into this incident by a committee of three officers of the rank of Executive Directors consisting of Executive Director/ Rolling Stock (Project), Executive Director/ Rolling Stock (O&M), Executive Director/ Operations. Prima facie it appears, to be a case of human error and negligence and appropriate action will be taken after the enquiry.

The Metro trains on the Magenta Line will connect nine stations from the Violet Line to Blue Line. The train will run from Kalkaji Mandir, Okhla NSIC, Sukhdev Vihar, Jamia Milia Islamia, Jasola Vihar, Shaheen Bagh, Kalindi Kunj, Okhla Bird Sanctuary and Botanical Garden. The Magenta Line is the first line on the Delhi Metro have no drivers. However, drivers will be present on the trains for some time.

Because the train's brakes, which were isolated (necessary for push/pull operations in the depot area when a train is required to move with a battery operated vehicle) were not normalized before moving the train on its own power, as soon as the operator brought the train at the ramp, it started rolling back, got derailed and hit the wall. \""

Id: 32
title: Identical Twins Can Open Apple FaceID Protected Devices
description: Apple's iPhone FaceID can be opened by an identical twin of the person who has registered their face to unlock the phone.

first report text: A worker in the Chinese city of Nanjing claims a colleague has bested the facial recognition technology on her new iPhone X — twice.

The woman, identified only by her surname Yan, told the Jiangsu Broadcasting Corp. that her co-worker was able to get into both phones — her original as well as the new one Apple gave her as a replacement, reports the South China Morning Post. 

An Apple spokesman told HuffPost that he couldn’t confirm the details of the story, nor did he have enough information to determine what might have gone wrong with the phones. He suspected that both women may have used the phone during its “passcode training” and that the phones may have been essentially “taught” to recognize both faces.

The facial recognition software has run into some glitches. It can sometimes mistake twins or siblings, according to Apple. The phone, too, may not accurately identify children under the age of 13 because their faces are not as definitely formed as adults’, according to an Apple security “white paper” on the technology.

Apple hasn’t yet confirmed a case of an unrelated adult cracking the phone’s facial recognition software, according to the Apple spokesman. The company insists that the probability of a random person accessing someone else’s iPhone X using the Face ID passcode is 1 in 1 million, versus 1 in 50,000 for Touch ID. Phil Schiller, Apple’s vice president of product marketing, conceded in September: “Of course, the statistics are lowered if that person shares a close genetic relationship with you.”

Unless Apple technicians examine the Chinese phones, it’s unclear what happened. An added complication is that a Chinese company has reportedly begun manufacturing a clone of the iPhone X — with unknown facial recognition capabilities.
