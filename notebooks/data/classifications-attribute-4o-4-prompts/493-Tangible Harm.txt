Always require the incident text, the taxonomy namespace, and the specific attribute short_name to perform classification.

Here is the incident text to classify:
Misogynistic influencer Andrew Tate is [currently in a Romanian prison](https://news.sky.com/story/andrew-tate-loses-latest-appeal-to-be-released-from-romanian-prison-amid-human-trafficking-case-12821602#:~:text=Andrew%20Tate's%20appeal%20against%20a,influencer%20will%20remain%20in%20prision.). But someone on TikTok is trying to convince legions of followers that Tate is free, posting videos, and giving self-help advice. 

“I’m back. I’m finally back,” a man in a black mask wearing a hoodie and white blazer says to over 2 million viewers on TikTok. Using the username [@drreality.life](https://www.tiktok.com/@drreality.life/video/7204907316452396294?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7167806110351935022), this man impersonates Tate, wearing an outfit he’s previously worn, using similar hand gestures as Tate, and using his distinctive voice, which may be AI-generated. Dr. Reality began posting on February 14, gaining over 200,000 followers and millions of views by telling viewers he is there to help them change their lives. 

After being alerted by Motherboard about the videos, TikTok banned @drreality.life. TikTok told Motherboard that the account violated community guidelines and all Andrew Tate content would be deleted, as he is currently banned from the platform.

So far, Dr. Reality has evaded answering viewers directly when they ask if he is Andrew Tate. He says things like “thanks for support!” in response to comments, without providing any more information. He frequently alludes to “being back” in videos by [saying things like](https://www.tiktok.com/@drreality.life/video/7204759517303819525) “If you think about it, you probably realized who I am.” Many people are falling for this schtick, saying things like “God bless you we all know you would be back❤️” and “its good to see you in good shape,all the best man.” 

By posing as Tate, Dr. Reality hopes to make a buck. The link in his bio goes to a site called [“Behind Real Reality,”](https://behindrealreality.myshopify.com/) where you can get an “Online Wealth Creation Course” for a sale price of €19,99. This is a knock-off version of [Tate’s own Hustler’s University](https://www.hu2.io/), which was an educational online program that cost $49.99 per month and taught mostly boys and young men how to “make money online.” 

Tate’s [program resembled multi-level marketing](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7g88q/andrew-tate-cancel-bounty-ksi) and taught students how to participate in an affiliate-link scheme that asked them to share viral clips of him. His [Hustler’s University was shut down](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/20/andrew-tate-money-making-scheme-for-fans-of-extreme-misogynist-closes) after financial services company Stripe stopped processing subscriptions for the platform, though a successor program is now active. Dr. Reality's website advertises it will only take “four weeks to turn your life around,” and leads customers to the [Dr. Reality private Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dr.reality/) page, which shows a picture of a young man with the name “Peter Bee.” “Dis be Peter Work Hard Have Yet to Play Hard,” the account’s bio reads. 

Making AI-generated voices has become a lot easier thanks to new startups such as ElevenLabs, [which said it found](https://twitter.com/elevenlabsio/status/1620032627075063811) an “increasing number of voice cloning misuse cases.” [Motherboard found 4chan members](https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy7mww/ai-voice-firm-4chan-celebrity-voices-emma-watson-joe-rogan-elevenlabs) using the product to generate voices of famous people like Joe Rogan, Ben Shapiro, and Emma Watson to spew racist and other hateful content. Later, the same trolls used AI-voice generators to [replicate voice actors’ voices](https://www.vice.com/en/article/93axnd/voice-actors-doxed-with-ai-voices-on-twitter) and had them read out the victim’s home addresses and posted them online. Motherboard reporter Joesph Cox [was also able to clone his own voice using AI](https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy7axa/how-i-broke-into-a-bank-account-with-an-ai-generated-voice) and break into his own bank account with the AI voice. These recent developments reveal the threat towards anyone who has videos or audio files of their voices online. It has become easy to impersonate anyone, even people who aren’t necessarily A-list celebrities. 

It seems that Dr. Reality is trying to take advantage of the fact that Tate is currently banned from platforms like TikTok—though he remains active on Twitter—to gain a following as he attempts to share “Tate’s comeback.” Tate, known for his deeply misogynistic comments, [was banned from a number of social media platforms in August](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/technology/andrew-tate-banned-tiktok-instagram.html), including TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, after he violated their hate speech policies. In December, he was arrested in Romania on suspicion of organized crime and human trafficking. He is currently being held in [detention for a third month](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64789944) after his appeal for release has been rejected for the fourth time. 

VICE World News reported that seven years before his arrest in Romania, Tate was [investigated over allegations](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvm43q/andrew-tate-arrest) of sexual assault and physical abuse in the UK. In the dozens of messages and voicenotes that [VICE World News reviewed](https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxn3dm/andrew-tate-whatsapps-arrest), Tate said “I love raping you” and “I fucking loved how much you hated it,” to a woman who accused him of rape.

Despite Tate being banned from TikTok, analysis by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) identified more than 100 accounts that frequently promote content featuring Tate on the platform in November, [as reported by _The Observer_](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/06/tiktok-still-hosting-toxic-posts-of-banned-influencer-andrew-tate).

In response to its investigation, TikTok said it would be removing the reported accounts and any “copycat” accounts that broke its rules on impersonation. We also reached out to the email listed on Dr. Reality’s website and did not receive any response.

_**Update:** This article was updated to reflect that TikTok banned the scammer’s account after being alerted by Motherboard._

title: Las Vegas Self-Driving Bus Involved in Accident
description: A self-driving public shuttle by Keolis North America and Navya was involved in a collision with a human-driven delivery truck in Las Vegas, Nevada on its first day of service.

first report text: **A self-driving shuttle bus in Las Vegas was involved in a crash on its first day of service.**

The vehicle - carrying "several" passengers - collided with a lorry driving at slow speed.

Nobody was injured in the incident which city officials say was the fault of the human driver of the lorry. The man was subsequently given a ticket by police.

The shuttle is the first of its kind to be used on public roads in the US.

The collision comes a day after Waymo - owned by Google's parent company Alphabet - announced it is launching a fully self-driving fleet of taxis in Phoenix, Arizona.

The Las Vegas shuttle, designed to ferry passengers to the famous strip, uses a system developed by Navya, a French company also [testing its technology in London](https://archive.ph/o/3FQuF/www.bbc.com/news/video_and_audio/headlines/41206468/london-trials-for-navya-shuttle-driverless-bus).

The shuttle carries up to 15 people and has a maximum speed of 45km/h, but typically travels at around 25km/h.

A spokesman for the City of Las Vegas told the BBC the crash was a "fender bender" - a minor collision - and that the shuttle would likely be back out on the road on Thursday after some routine diagnostics tests.

"A delivery truck was coming out of an alley," public information officer Jace Radke said.

"The shuttle did what it was supposed to do and stopped. Unfortunately the human element, the driver of the truck, didn't stop."

Self-driving technology has been involved in crashes before, but almost all reported incidents have been due to human error.

Earlier this year an autonomous vehicle being tested by ride-sharing company Uber in Arizona rolled over after another driver on the road failed to give way.

An incident involving a Tesla Model S, which has some autonomous functions, killed a man in 2016. An investigation ruled that computer failings were partly to blame. Tesla was instructed to make the limitations of its technology clearer to drivers.

Experts have said that even with these incidents, self-driving technology is already capable of making our roads significantly safer. [A study from the RAND Corporation, published this week](https://archive.ph/o/3FQuF/https://www.rand.org/blog/articles/2017/11/why-waiting-for-perfect-autonomous-vehicles-may-cost-lives.html), argued that self-driving technology should be rolled out despite its imperfections.

"Waiting for highly autonomous vehicles that are many times safer than human drivers misses opportunities to save lives," the report said.

"It is the very definition of allowing perfect to be the enemy of good."

title: Driverless Train in Delhi Crashes due to Braking Failure
description: A driverless metro train in Delhi, India crashed during a test run due to faulty brakes.

first report text: A Delhi Metro mishap has been reported on Tuesday. (ANI PHOTO)

Delhi Metro accident today: On December 19, during the trial run of the Magenta line, one of the trains reportedly met with an accident as it tore through an iron grill at the Kalindi Kunj Metro depot. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to visit on December 25 to inaugurate Delhi Metro’s new Magenta Line which connects Delhi Metro’s Blue line to Violet Line, from Botanical Garden to Kalindi Kunj. As of now, there are no reports of casualties. The Magenta Line came as a breather for many commuters as it will reduce the distance between Noida and South Delhi to a mere 19-minute ride. Explaining the incident, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation issued a press release stating the reason behind the mishap.

In its press release, DMRC has ordered a high-level enquiry into this incident. The enquiry will have a committee of three Executive Directors: Executive Director/ Rolling Stock (Project), Executive Director/ Rolling Stock (O&M), Executive Director/ Operations. The press release explains the entire incident.

READ the full text by DMRC on Delhi Metro accident today:

An incident occurred at 3.40 PM (1540hrs) at the Kalindi Kunj Metro depot today which is under commissioning. A trial train was moved from the workshop without testing the brake system as a result of which, while the train was moving up the ramp for washing, it rolled back and hit the adjacent boundary wall. No person was injured in the incident.

As per normal procedure prescribed, when a train enters the workshop, the brakes of the train are decommissioned so that the train and its systems including the brakes can be freely checked. As per procedure, once the train is again re-commissioned, the brakes should have been tested by the maintenance staff in the depot before the train left the shed. The train movement inside the workshop area is done manually and not by the signalling system.

Prima facie, it appears, this was not done and subsequently, the person who took charge of the train from the maintenance staff also did not check the brake and proceeded with the train up to the washing plant built on a ramp. While stopping at the ramp, since the brakes were not available, the train rolled back causing this incident.

MD, DMRC has ordered a high-level enquiry into this incident by a committee of three officers of the rank of Executive Directors consisting of Executive Director/ Rolling Stock (Project), Executive Director/ Rolling Stock (O&M), Executive Director/ Operations. Prima facie it appears, to be a case of human error and negligence and appropriate action will be taken after the enquiry.

The Metro trains on the Magenta Line will connect nine stations from the Violet Line to Blue Line. The train will run from Kalkaji Mandir, Okhla NSIC, Sukhdev Vihar, Jamia Milia Islamia, Jasola Vihar, Shaheen Bagh, Kalindi Kunj, Okhla Bird Sanctuary and Botanical Garden. The Magenta Line is the first line on the Delhi Metro have no drivers. However, drivers will be present on the trains for some time.

Because the train's brakes, which were isolated (necessary for push/pull operations in the depot area when a train is required to move with a battery operated vehicle) were not normalized before moving the train on its own power, as soon as the operator brought the train at the ramp, it started rolling back, got derailed and hit the wall. \""

title: Arkansas's Opaque Algorithm to Allocate Health Care Excessively Cut Down Hours for Beneficiaries
description: Beneficiaries of the Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS)'s Medicaid waiver program were allocated excessively fewer hours of caretaker visit via an algorithm deployed to boost efficiency, which reportedly contained errors and whose outputs varied wildly despite small input changes.

first report text: Artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic decision-making systems — algorithms that analyze massive amounts of data and make predictions about the future — are increasingly affecting Americans’ daily lives. People are compelled to include [buzzwords](https://www.zipjob.com/blog/get-your-resume-past-applicant-tracking-systems/) in their resumes to get past AI-driven hiring software. Algorithms are deciding who will get housing or financial loan opportunities. And biased [testing software](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/02/01/u-illinois-says-goodbye-proctorio) is forcing students of color and students with disabilities to grapple with increased anxiety that they may be locked out of their exams or flagged for cheating. But there’s another frontier of AI and algorithms that should worry us greatly: the use of these systems in medical care and treatment.

The use of AI and algorithmic decision-making systems in medicine are increasing even though current regulation may be insufficient to detect harmful racial biases in these tools. Details about the tools’ development are largely unknown to clinicians and the public — a lack of transparency that threatens to automate and worsen racism in the health care system. Last week, the [FDA issued guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/109618/download) significantly broadening the scope of the tools it plans to regulate. This broadening guidance emphasizes that more must be done to combat bias and promote equity amid the growing number and increasing use of AI and algorithmic tools.

In 2019, a [bombshell study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342) found that a clinical algorithm many hospitals were using to decide which patients need care was showing racial bias — Black patients had to be deemed much sicker than white patients to be recommended for the same care. This happened because the algorithm had been trained on past data on health care spending, which reflects a history in which Black patients had less to spend on their health care compared to white patients, due to longstanding wealth and income disparities. While this algorithm’s bias was eventually detected and corrected, the incident raises the question of how many more clinical and medical tools may be similarly discriminatory.

Another algorithm, created to determine how many hours of aid Arkansas residents with disabilities would receive each week, was criticized after [making extreme cuts](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17144260/healthcare-medicaid-algorithm-arkansas-cerebral-palsy) to in-home care. Some residents attributed extreme disruptions to their lives and even hospitalization to the sudden cuts. A resulting lawsuit found that several errors in the algorithm — errors in how it characterized the medical needs of people with certain disabilities — were directly to blame for inappropriate cuts made. Despite this outcry, the group that developed the flawed algorithm still creates tools used in health care settings in nearly half of U.S. states as well as internationally.

[One recent study](https://news.emory.edu/stories/2022/05/hs_ai_systems_detect_patient_race_27-05-2022/story.html) found that an AI tool trained on medical images, like x-rays and CT scans, had unexpectedly learned to discern patients’ self-reported race. It learned to do this even when it was trained only with the goal of helping clinicians diagnose patient images. This technology’s ability to tell patients’ race — even when their doctor cannot — could be abused in the future, or unintentionally direct worse care to communities of color without detection or intervention.

Some algorithms used in the clinical space are severely under-regulated in the U.S. The U.S Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its subagency the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are tasked with regulating medical devices — with devices ranging from a tongue depressor to a pacemaker and now, medical AI systems. While some of these medical devices (including AI) and tools that aid physicians in treatment and diagnosis are regulated, other algorithmic decision-making tools used in clinical, administrative, and public health settings — such as those that predict risk of mortality, likelihood of readmission, and in-home care needs — are not required to be reviewed or regulated by the FDA or any regulatory body.

This lack of oversight can lead to biased algorithms being used widely by hospitals and state public health systems, contributing to increased discrimination against Black and Brown patients, people with disabilities, and other marginalized communities. In some cases, this failure to regulate can lead to wasted money and lives lost. One such AI tool, developed to detect sepsis early, is used by more than 170 hospitals and health systems. But a [recent study](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2021/12/16/artificial-intelligence-can-improve-health-care-but-not-without-human-oversight) revealed the tool failed to predict this life-threatening illness in 67 percent of patients who developed it, and generated false sepsis alerts on thousands of patients who did not. Acknowledging this failure was the result of under-regulation, the FDA’s new guidelines point to these tools as examples of products it will now regulate as medical devices.

The FDA’s approach to regulating drugs, which involves publicly shared data that is scrutinized by review panels for adverse effects and events contrasts to its approach to regulating medical AI and algorithmic tools. Regulating medical AI presents a novel issue and will require considerations that differ from those applicable to the hardware devices the FDA is used to regulating. These devices include [pulse oximeters](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/07/11/1110370384/when-it-comes-to-darker-skin-pulse-oximeters-fall-short/), [thermal thermometers](https://news.emory.edu/stories/2022/09/hs_bhavani_jama_racial_differences_thermometers_detecting_fevers_06-09-2022/story.html), and [scalp electrodes](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/GetUrlReputation)—each of which have been found to reflect racial or ethnic bias in how well they function in subgroups. News of these biases only underscores how vital it is to properly regulate these tools and ensure they don’t perpetuate bias against vulnerable racial and ethnic groups.

While the FDA suggests that device manufacturers test their devices for racial and ethnic biases before marketing to the general public, this step is not required. Perhaps more important than assessments after a device is developed is transparency during its development. A [STAT+ News study](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/11/breast-cancer-disparities-artificial-intelligence-fda/) found many AI tools approved or cleared by the FDA do not include information about the diversity of the data on which the AI was trained, and that the number of these tools being cleared is [increasing rapidly](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/03/fda-clearances-artificial-intelligence-data/). Another [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01595-0) found AI tools “consistently and selectively under-diagnosed under-served patient populations,” finding the under-diagnosis rate was higher for marginalized communities who disproportionately don’t have access to medical care. This is unacceptable when these tools may make decisions that have life or death consequences.

Equitable treatment by the health care system is a civil rights issue. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the many ways in which existing societal inequities produce health care inequities — a complex reality that humans can attempt to comprehend, but that is difficult to accurately reflect in an algorithm. The promise of AI in medicine was that it could help remove bias from a deeply biased institution and improve health care outcomes; instead, it threatens to automate this bias.

Policy changes and collaboration among key stakeholders, including state and federal regulators, medical, public health, and clinical advocacy groups and organizations, are needed to address these gaps and inefficiencies. To start, as detailed in a [new ACLU white paper](https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/aclu-white-paper-ai-health-care-may-worsen-medical-racism):

*   Public reporting of demographic information should be required.
*   The FDA should require an impact assessment of any differences in device performance by racial or ethnic subgroup as part of the clearance or approval process.
*   Device labels should reflect the results of this impact assessment.
*   The FTC should collaborate with HHS and other federal bodies to establish best practices that device manufacturers not under FDA regulation should follow to lessen the risk of racial or ethnic bias in their tools.

Rather than learn of racial and ethnic bias embedded in clinical and medical algorithms and devices from bombshell publications revealing what amounts to medical and clinical malpractice, the HHS and FDA and other stakeholders must work to ensure that medical racism becomes a relic of the past rather than a certainty of the future.

title: Frontline workers protest at Stanford after hospital distributed vaccine to administrators
description: In 2020, Stanford Medical Center's distribution algorithm only designated 7 of 5,000 vaccines to Medical Residents, who are frontline workers regularly exposed to COVID-19.

first report text: When resident physicians at Stanford Medical Center—many of whom work on the front lines of the covid-19 pandemic—found out that only seven out of over 1,300 of them had been prioritized for the first 5,000 doses of the covid vaccine, they were shocked. Then, when they saw who else had made the list, including administrators and doctors seeing patients remotely from home, they were angry.

During a planned photo op to celebrate the first vaccinations taking place on Friday, December 18, at least 100 residents showed up to protest. Hospital leadership apologized for not prioritizing them, and blamed the errors on “a very complex algorithm.”

“Our algorithm, that the ethicists, infectious disease experts worked on for weeks … clearly didn’t work right,” Tim Morrison, the director of the ambulatory care team, told residents at the event in a video posted online.

Many saw that as an excuse, especially since hospital leadership had been made aware of the problem on Tuesday—when only five residents made the list—and responded not by fixing the algorithm, but by adding two more residents for a total of seven.

“One of the core attractions of algorithms is that they allow the powerful to blame a black box for politically unattractive outcomes for which they would otherwise be responsible,” Roger McNamee, a prominent Silicon Valley insider turned critic, wrote on Twitter. “But *people* decided who would get the vaccine,” tweeted Veena Dubal, a professor of law at the University of California, Hastings, who researches technology and society. “The algorithm just carried out their will.”

But what exactly was Stanford’s “will”? We took a look at the algorithm to find out what it was meant to do.

How the algorithm works

The slide describing the algorithm came from residents who had received it from their department chair. It is not a complex machine-learning algorithm (which are often referred to as “black boxes”) but a rules-based formula for calculating who would get the vaccine first at Stanford. It considers three categories: “employee-based variables,” which have to do with age; “job-based variables”; and guidelines from the California Department of Public Health. For each category, staff received a certain number of points, with a total possible score of 3.48. Presumably, the higher the score, the higher the person’s priority in line. (Stanford Medical Center did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the algorithm over the weekend.)

The employee variables increase a person’s score linearly with age, and extra points are added to those over 65 or under 25. This gives priority to the oldest and youngest staff, which disadvantages residents and other frontline workers who are typically in the middle of the age range.

Job variables contribute the most to the overall score. The algorithm counts the prevalence of covid-19 among employees’ job roles and department in two different ways, but the difference between them is not entirely clear. Neither the residents nor two unaffiliated experts we asked to review the algorithm understood what these criteria meant, and Stanford Medical Center did not respond to a request for comment. They also consider the proportion of tests taken by job role as a percentage of the medical center’s total number of tests collected.

Many states rolled out exposure notification services after covid transmissions started surging, but health experts say new apps can still help.

What these factors do not take into account is exposure to patients with covid-19, say residents. That means the algorithm did not distinguish between those who had caught covid from patients and those who got it from community spread—including employees working remotely. And, as first reported by ProPublica, residents were told that because they rotate between departments rather than maintain a single assignment, they lost out on points associated with the departments where they worked.

The algorithm’s third category refers to the California Department of Public Health’s vaccine allocation guidelines. These focus on exposure risk as the single highest factor for vaccine prioritization. The guidelines are intended primarily for county and local governments to decide how to prioritize the vaccine, rather than how to prioritize between a hospital’s departments. But they do specifically include residents, along with the departments where they work, in the highest-priority tier.

It may be that the “CDPH range” factor gives residents a higher score, but still not high enough to counteract the other criteria.

“Why did they do it that way?”

Stanford tried to factor in a lot more variables than other medical facilities, but Jeffrey Kahn, the director of the Johns Hopkins Berkman Institute of Bioethics, says the approach was overcomplicated. “The more there are different weights for different things, it then becomes harder to understand—‘Why did they do it that way?’” he says.

Kahn, who sat on Johns Hopkins’ 20-member committee on vaccine allocation, says his university allocated vaccines based simply on job and risk of exposure to covid-19.

He says that decision was based on discussions that purposefully included different perspectives—including those of residents—and in coordination with other hospitals in Maryland. Elsewhere, the University of California San Francisco’s plan is based on a similar assessment of risk of exposure to the virus. Mass General Brigham in Boston categorizes employees into four groups based on department and job location, according to an internal email reviewed by MIT Technology Review.

“There’s so little trust around so much related to the pandemic, we cannot squander it.”

“It’s really important [for] any approach like this to be transparent and public …and not something really hard to figure out,” Kahn says. “There’s so little trust around so much related to the pandemic, we cannot squander it.”

Algorithms are commonly used in health care to rank patients by risk level in an effort to distribute care and resources more equitably. But the more variables used, the harder it is to assess whether the calculations might be flawed.

For example, in 2019, a study published in Science showed that 10 widely used algorithms for distributing care in the US ended up favoring white patients over Black ones. The problem, it turned out, was that the algorithms’ designers assumed that patients who spent more on health care were more sickly and needed more help. In reality, higher spenders are also richer, and more likely to be white. As a result, the algorithm allocated less care to Black patients with the same medical conditions as white ones.

Irene Chen, an MIT doctoral candidate who studies the use of fair algorithms in health care, suspects this is what happened at Stanford: the formula’s designers chose variables that they believed would serve as good proxies for a given staffer’s level of covid risk. But they didn’t verify that these proxies led to sensible outcomes, or respond in a meaningful way to the community’s input when the vaccine plan came to light on Tuesday last week. “It’s not a bad thing that people had thoughts about it afterward,” says Chen. “It’s that there wasn’t a mechanism to fix it.”

A canary in the coal mine?

After the protests, Stanford issued a formal apology, saying it would revise its distribution plan.

Hospital representatives did not respond to questions about who they would include in new planning processes, or whether the algorithm would continue to be used. An internal email summarizing the medical school’s response, shared with MIT Technology Review, states that neither program heads, department chairs, attending physicians, nor nursing staff were involved in the original algorithm design. Now, however, some faculty are pushing to have a bigger role, eliminating the algorithms’ results completely and instead giving division chiefs and chairs the authority to make decisions for their own teams.

Other department chairs have encouraged residents to get vaccinated first. Some have even asked faculty to bring residents with them when they get vaccinated, or delay their shots so that others could go first.

Some residents are bypassing the university health-care system entirely. Nuriel Moghavem, a neurology resident who was the first to publicize the problems at Stanford, tweeted on Friday afternoon that he had finally received his vaccine—not at Stanford, but at a public county hospital in Santa Clara County.

“I got vaccinated today to protect myself, my family, and my patients,” he tweeted. “But I only had the opportunity because my public county hospital believes that residents are critical front-line providers. Grateful.”

title: Kidney Testing Method Allegedly Underestimated Risk of Black Patients
description: Decades-long use of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) method to test kidney function which considers race has been criticized by physicians and medical students for its racist history and inaccuracy against Black patients.

first report text: **BACKGROUND:** Advancing health equity entails reducing disparities in care. African-American patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have poorer outcomes, including dialysis access placement and transplantation. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) equations, which assign higher eGFR values to African-American patients, may be a mechanism for inequitable outcomes. Electronic health record–based registries enable population-based examination of care across racial groups.

**OBJECTIVE:** To examine the impact of the race multiplier for African-Americans in the CKD-EPI eGFR equation on CKD classification and care delivery.

**DESIGN:** Cross-sectional study

**SETTING:** Two large academic medical centers and affiliated community primary care and specialty practices.

**PARTICIPANTS:** A total of 56,845 patients in the Partners HealthCare System CKD registry in June 2019, among whom 2225 (3.9%) were African-American.

**MEASUREMENT:** Exposures included race, age, sex, comorbidities, and eGFR. Outcomes were transplant referral and dialysis access placement.

**RESULTS:** Of 2225 African-American patients, 743 (33.4%) would hypothetically be reclassified to a more severe CKD stage if the race multiplier were removed from the CKD-EPI equation. Similarly, 167 of 687 (24.3%) would be reclassified from stage 3B to stage 4. Finally, 64 of 2069 patients (3.1%) would be reassigned from eGFR > 20 ml/min/1.73 m2 to eGFR ≤ 20 ml/min/1.73 m2, meeting the criterion for accumulating kidney transplant priority. Zero of 64 African-American patients with an eGFR ≤ 20 ml/min/1.73 m2 after the race multiplier was removed were referred, evaluated, or waitlisted for kidney transplant, compared to 19.2% of African-American patients with eGFR ≤ 20 ml/min/1.73 m2 with the default CKD-EPI equation.

**LIMITATIONS:** Single healthcare system in the Northeastern United States and relatively small African-American patient cohort may limit generalizability.

**CONCLUSIONS:** Our study reveals a meaningful impact of race-adjusted eGFR on the care provided to the African-American CKD patient population.

title: Image Classification of Battle Tanks
description: A potentially apocryphal story in which an image classifier was produced to differentiate types of battle tanks, but the resulting model keyed in on environmental attributes rather than tank attributes

first report text: The following former incidents have been converted to "[issues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10384)" following an update to the [incident definition and ingestion criteria](/editors-guide).

### [21: Tougher Turing Test Exposes Chatbots’ Stupidity](https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/21)

**Description:** The 2016 Winograd Schema Challenge highlighted how even the most successful AI systems entered into the Challenge were only successful 3% more often than random chance.

**Why Downgraded?** This is an academic finding showing a weakness of the technology rather than a harm event.

### [85: AI attempts to ease fear of robots, blurts out it can’t ‘avoid destroying humankind’](https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/85)

Confirmed migration by editors - Incident 85 - likely does not fit current incident criteria, where GPT-3 was manipulated by human editors to exaggerate harm, borderline sensationalism.
https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/85

**Description:** On September 8, 2020, the Guardian published an op-ed generated by OpenAI’s GPT-3 text generating AI that included threats to destroy humankind.

**Why Downgraded?** Unclear who was harmed, if anyone, via the events described.
