You are an AI assistant that helps classify AI incidents according to a specific taxonomy attribute.

Your task is to analyze the provided incident text and classify it ONLY for the specified taxonomy attribute: "Tangible Harm".

Always require the incident text, the taxonomy namespace, and the specific attribute short_name to perform classification.

Here is the incident text to classify:
Government agencies around the world use data-driven algorithms to allocate enforcement resources. Even when such algorithms are formally neutral with respect to protected characteristics like race, there is widespread concern that they can disproportionately burden vulnerable groups. We study differences in Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit rates between Black and non-Black taxpayers. Because neither we nor the IRS observe taxpayer race, we employ a novel partial identification strategy to estimate these differences. Despite race-blind audit selection, we find that Black taxpayers are audited at 2.9 to 4.7 times the rate of non-Black taxpayers. The main source of the disparity is differing audit rates by race among taxpayers claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Using counterfactual audit selection models, we find that maximizing the detection of underreported taxes would not lead to Black taxpayers being audited at higher rates. In contrast, certain policies tend to increase the audit rate of Black taxpayers: (1) designing audit selection algorithms to minimize the "no-change rate"; (2) targeting erroneously claimed refundable credits rather than total under-reporting; and (3) limiting the share of more complex EITC returns that can be selected for audit. Our results highlight how seemingly technocratic choices about algorithmic design can embed important policy values and trade-offs.

Here is the specific attribute to classify:
Tangible Harm

Here is the definition for the target attribute "Tangible Harm":
{
  "short_name": "Tangible Harm",
  "short_description": "Did tangible harm (loss, damage or injury ) occur? ",
  "long_description": "An assessment of whether tangible harm, imminent tangible harm, or non-imminent tangible harm occurred. This assessment does not consider the context of the tangible harm, if an AI was involved, or if there is an identifiable, specific, and harmed entity. It is also not assessing if an intangible harm occurred. It is only asking if tangible harm occurred and what its imminency was.",
  "permitted_values": [
    "tangible harm definitively occurred",
    "imminent risk of tangible harm (near miss) did occur",
    "non-imminent risk of tangible harm (an issue) occurred",

title: Robot kills worker at German Volkswagen plant
description: A Volkswagen plant robot "crushed to death" a worker by pinning him to a metal plate. 

first report text: A 22-year-old contractor has been killed at a Volkswagen factor in Germany after a stationary robot he was helping to set up grabbed and crushed him to death against a metal plate.

VW spokesman Heiko Hillwig confirmed the man died on Monday at the plant in Baunatal, about 100 kilometres north of Frankfurt.

He said initial conclusions indicate that human error was to blame, rather than a problem with the robot, which can be programmed to perform various tasks in the assembly process.

He said it normally operates within a confined area at the plant, grabbing car parts and manipulating them.

title: Worker killed by robot in welding accident at car parts factory in India
description: A factory robot at the SKH Metals Factory in Manesar, India pierced and killed 24-year-old worker Ramji Lal when Lal reached behind the machine to dislodge a piece of metal stuck in the machine.

first report text: Representational pic

It reads like the beginning of a robo-acocalypse sci-fi movie, but in this case the damage and the tragedy is all too real. A 24-year-old contractor who worked at a plant in Manesar in Haryana received an electric shock when he came in contact with a robot.

The victim had apparently moved too close to the robot while adjusting a metal sheet that had come unstuck. The 24-old-year contractor was rushed to a nearby hospital, but was pronounced dead on arrival.

The victim worked as a loader at an car ancillary company at the Industrial Model Township (IMT) in Manesar. He was at work in the welding unit that has special-purpose machines and robotic welding lines. Around 63 workers and 39 robots were on duty when the accident took place.

A co-worker at the plant stated that the robot is pre-programmed to weld metal sheets it lifts. One such sheet got dislodged and the 24-year-old contractor reached from behind the machine to adjust it. This was when welding sticks attached to the pre-programmed device pierced his abdomen.

Such fatalities are rare as robots are generally kept in enclosures to prevent contact with workers. On June 29, a worker at a Volkswagen factory in Germany died after a robot grabbed him and crushed him against a metal plate.

title: Security Robot Drowns Itself in a Fountain
description: A Knightscope K5 security robot ran itself into a water fountain in Washington, DC.

first report text: A security guard robot has met a watery end in a shopping centre water fountain, prompting a social media storm of doomsday predictions about suicidal robots and Marvin-related humour.

The Knightscope security robot was patrolling the Georgetown Waterfront shopping complex in Washington D.C. on Monday when it apparently launched itself to its death.

"Our D.C. office building got a security robot. It drowned itself," one Twitter user Bilal Farooqui‏ wrote.

"We were promised flying cars, instead we got suicidal robots."

Others tweeted images of the robot's human colleagues mounting a rescue from the fountain.

The robot is a Knightscope security robot, used by several Californian shopping centres for security. It's designed to identify anomalies in its environment, and then alert other (human) guards to any security threats.

While some mourned the passing of 'Steve the robot', others used the droid's untimely end to take down Elon Musk's predictions that artificial intelligence poses a fundamental threat to humanity.

Of course, it's more likely that the security bot simply didn't detect the body of water -- which is only slightly below ground-level -- as anything other than solid ground, and so drove straight into it.

The Knightscope's company website says the security robots' "autonomous presence" allows them to "guide themselves through even the most complex environments" -- but not, apparently, bodies of water.

But that didn't stop Twitter going into sci-fi overdrive:

If you're a security robot and feel suicidal! Please know you can get help! It's not worth ending your life! #securityrobot#dc — Thomas Winzeler (@Theaggiefan1) July 17, 2017

I don't blame the poor robot. All those human security guards "metal shaming" him ever time he came to work. 👮 The humanity! — Shawn 🌞 Strickland (@Strickalator) July 17, 2017

It's not the first time a Knightscope robot has run into mischief.

In April this year, one of the 136-kilogram security guards was knocked down by a drunk man in Silicon Valley while patrolling the Knightscope offices. And last year, the same kind of robot knocked down and then ran over a toddler at a California mall.

At the time, Knightscope vice president of marketing and sales Stacy Dean Stephens defended the robots as "incredibly safe" -- but not, it would seem, for their own self-preservation.

With predictions that robots will rob a billion humans of their jobs before too long, it's nice to know we can still do some things better.

Return your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "classification": {
    "namespace": "CSETv1",
    "attributes": [
      {"short_name": "Tangible Harm", "value_json": ""value""} 
    ]
  },
  "explanation": "A detailed explanation of your classification choice for Tangible Harm.",
  "confidence": "A confidence score between 0 and 1 for this attribute classification"
}

DO NOT include any other text in your response, nor any other characters.
DO NOT start your response with ```json or ```
Ensure that ONLY the attribute "Tangible Harm" is included in your classification.
